### Recipe

----

1. Pre-heat oven to 180C for atleast 10 mins
2. Blend-in bananas, oil & sugars in a large bowl. Mix in cinnamon powder & vanilla.
3. Sift flour with baking powder & salt (3 times or as much as your patience allows you to :-D)
4. Fold the flour mix into the banana-oil mix in the large boil. Add the nuts & fold in (dont mix too much)
5. Pour this delicious mix into a greased bread-tin or a 8 inch cake pan.
6. Bake for 30-40 mins or until a tooth-pick inserted in the cake comes out clean.

  

*Some successfull alterations made to the original recipe that's worked:*

  1. *Reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup & added 1 tablespoon of chopped figs.*
  2. *Skipped baking-soda all-together & reduced baking-powder to 1 teaspoon instead of 1.5*
  3. *I have baked it with [coconut-sugar](http://farmmadefoods.com/coconut-sugar.html), as well as brown-sugar. My personal favourite is with coconut sugar!*
