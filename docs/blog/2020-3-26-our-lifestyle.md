How our existing lifestyle: minimalism, low-carbon-footprint, vegetarianism & value-centric work ethics helped us transition to the current "lockdown" lifestyle with ease: 

1. Our decision of not having a maid has paid off well now - so we continue to do our daily chores.
2. We love home cooked food (almost never done a home delivery - also to avoid the plastic packaging). Since we both love to cook, we are not really dependent on a cook. Currently, we have been experimenting more on raw food which needs much less prep-time & is no doubt a healthier alternative!
3. Its been ages we shopped at supermarkets, as an attempt to avoid plastic & to support local farmers - localisation is THE solution to a lot of environment related problems (is my belief). We are lucky to have a store that sells these products very close to home. This local store - [Paramparya](http://www.earthamag.org/stories/paaramparya) supplied me all the groceries I needed for the next 20 days (zero plastic packaging).
4. Veggies & fruits come from this excellent organisation called [Navadarshanam](http://navadarshanam.org/) - who are doing an amazing job in keeping the supplies flowing in every week (even during the lockdown - inspite of them having to cross the state borders). They supply vegetables from farmers who practice chemical free farming & are trying to grow non-gmo crops (basically desi seasonal sabzi).
5. We are vegetarians by choice (been about 10 years now) so there is no need step out to buy meat.
6. We have stopped consuming milk & any dairy products since a year now (again due to plastic and its hard to find a good doodh-wala in the city) so we continue to brew some wonderful black coffee & spice teas (elaichi, cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, dry ginger etc). Terrace garden provides us some fresh aromatic herbs like lemon-grass, tulsi, peppermint etc.
7. We [compost](https://dailydump.org/shopping/index.php/composters/home-composters.html) all our kitchen waste (our neighbours also contribute their kitchen remains) - which in turn is used as manure in our garden. We produce very very little dry waste - so the dependency on the garbage truck is very minimal - maybe once a month. Menstural cups & cloth pads have completely eliminated the use of sanitary pads which would have needed immediate disposing.
8. At work we recently switched to virtual work-space model, so as an organisation we were ready to work remotely since the last week of Feb. And since we believe in value-based work where number of hours spent is not what matters but the value we generate (and also because we are small company) - this model works with extreme efficiency.
9. Just started [learning](https://akashguitarclass.business.site/) this beautiful instrument - Guitar. So everytime I practice, Sagar gets a live  performance (well, sometimes the same tune a 100 times :-P)
10. I have been practicing [yoga](http://theyogaplace.in/) for a few years now & can manage to do a 1hr practice by myself & all it needs is a mat! Sagar has joined me too (it took 10 years & a lockdown to convince him :-P)
11. [Bioenzyme](https://kaustubam.blogspot.com/2017/02/how-to-make-bio-enzyme-or-garbage.html) (a multi-purpose, natural cleaner produced from lemon peels) is stocked up for atleast 3 months so no need to worry about buying any cleaning agents.
12. I love [baking](http://www.lovefoodeat.com/whole-wheat-banana-chocolate-loaf/) & have mostly shifted to Vegan reciepes since more than a year - which means no need for eggs/butter. Just need whole-wheat flour, jaggery & coconut oil (all non-perishable goods). So snacks are taken care!
13. We have been visiting a naturopathy doctor - [Dr Prince](http://wikimapia.org/35309500/Dr-Prince-Kasavanahalli) for about 8 years now, so dont depend on any alopathy medicines and thereby dont have to step out to buy them either.
14. We dont use toilet paper/kitchen paper rolls - so its okay if the shops go OutOfStock.
15. Very less dependency on electronic appliances, so even if something breaks down we have a manual alternative to back it up. For example:
      - Mixer can be replaced with age old motor&pistle.
      - We dont like to cook in bulk & then store in the fridge, so even if fridge comes down - we dont have a lot to loose. 
      - We store water in clay pot (matka) & clay bottle which keeps the water in just the perfect temprature, so no need of "fridge ka paani".
      - We have moved out of RO/any electric water purifier, back to the basic ceramic water filters. 
      - We mostly wash our clothes by hand - again possible due to minimalism, especially Sagar's ward-robe is very limited & strictly numbered.
      - We take cold-water shower (a big shift for me - but I am so glad now!)  - so no need for a geyser.
16. Other therapuetic activities to engage:
      - Gardening - its so rewarding every time you see a seed sprout / a new flower bloom / a fresh new leaf (pallavi) / or to cook that tiny little tomato & that fresh fat chilli!
      - Spinning (charka) - best time to make your own thread.
      - Reading books - I am sure everybody has atleast one book the pipeline, sitting there waiting for your precious attention :-)
      - Playing games (board games, word games etc) - we have some traditional games like AhstaChamma (we call it dayalu) which you will never get tired of playing.
      - Listening to [music](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcDPoRQ6N1p-4xT2HKJzueE0vanvGFrkq) in some beautiful golden light (candles are the best!)
      - Every Wednesday we try to appreciate the darkness by keeping lights off & using lamps/candles. So that way our eyes get sharper & we become aware of how dependent we have become on bright lit environment.
17. This is probably the best time to pick up a hobby / get into a habbit & stick to it for these *21 days* - so why not start meditation, helps you clear your mind & thereby helps you focus better & be mindful.



*Honest disclaimer: Maybe having a partner who shares similar values (and then takes it to next level) has made a lot of the above possible. Also a workplace with extreme flexibility & more-a-mentor-than-boss kind of CEO are key factors for us being able to experiment so much. So please keep this in mind & dont be too judgemental (towards me & yourself :-) )*     



## FAQs



#### What is the motive behind publishing this blog?

- Hope to motivate another soul, another being who is in search of similar alternatives & hope this gives that extra push to **Go For It!**
- To make people re-think about the little daily decisions & choices that have been made.
- To provide ways to slow-down their life & appreciate the many small every-day things.



#### Why we chose not to have a maid?

  - Managing their timing & our flexible lifestyle started getting difficult.
  - I found them invading my privacy way too often - "have a baby" advices..
  - They find it impossible to adapt to our chemical-free alternatives like washing dishes with ash & Bioenzymea and then store the grey-water from the dish-washing for the plants.. all this is too much to ask for.
  - Managing my emotions is one thing - managing their mood tantrums was another task!
  - How much to pay - was always the toughest decision for me.. I probably ended up inflating their salary :-P
  - The whole concept of somebody coming & doing my work & me going to the gym/park to burn calories as she sweats doing the pocha at my house was not something I could fathom.



#### Why not find a local milk vendor (doodh-wala)?

  - The cows they milk are not fed grass, they are left to loiter in the streets, which end up eating garbage & plastic. 
  - Too much adulteration. 
  - All other A2 milk options like Akshayakalpa, Swarg, Happy Cows - have plastic packaging.



#### Why are we vegetarian?

  - The animal lover in me just cannot eat an animal. 
  - I have never enjoyed the taste since childhood.
  - My body feels good when I eat vegetables, stomach processes it well.
